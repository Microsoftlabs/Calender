# Calender
A simple calendar with no floor limits on years

## Introduction
This program can show date, day, month of any year as long as it is smaller than <double> data-type size (307 place of digits).
Based purely on Gregonian Calendar(not Julian calendar). Hence no account for 11 days in September 1752 (Google it!).
The main motivation behind this project was just look outside bars set by default calendar available in smartphones those days.

## About project
This project is a compilation of the few projects I made while stepping my foot in GUI programming 3~4 years back. Entire project is written in Processing JAVA.
One can find more info about that language [here](https://www.processing.org).

## How to Run
You will need a PDE to run this code and/or to compile it to distribute it. It is as simple installing Chrome after installing your Windows.
You can get PDE [here](https://www.processing.org/download).
